# Train Scheduler
Week 7 Assignment: Train Scheduler

The challenge was to create a train scheduler that accepts schedule data from the "schedule administrator". Arrival time and the number of minutes the train is away from the stations is computed based on the train's first arrival time and how frequently the train makes stops at the stattion.

Relevent data is outputted as a table in the Current Train Schedule section. Current Train Schedule is also updated for new site visitors.
